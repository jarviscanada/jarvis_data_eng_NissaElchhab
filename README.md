# Nissa Elchhab . Jarvis Consulting

I am a Junior Software Developer, with experience in Java, React, Golang, and Ruby on Rails. I graduated from OpenClassrooms with a E.U bachelor's equivalent. I am passionate about software quality and well-engineered solutions that take into account green or efficient tech, and social responsibility. I was, previously, a member of the Tier 3 Network Assurance and Provisioning Team at Telus, as a Telecom Network Technician. Besides that, I hold a diploma as a Telecom/electronics Technologist and a Bachelor in Business Administration with a Marketing major. I believe that lean, secure, and Open Source software can bring a unique added value to all the stakeholders, and clearer communication and can enable optimized and agile solutions to market needs. My other interests are Information Security and science education.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab/tree/main/linux_sql)]: This app, which consists of a server and node agents, assists cluster admin team to survey, collect, store and monitor cluster nodes. It uses standard Linux commands and `/sys` filesystem to collect a node's configuration and real-time information. The server collects and stores that data in a PostgreSQL database for documentation and querying. The app is deployed through a lightweight Docker container and uses bash shell's scripting language.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab/tree/masterhttps://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab/tree/main/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: This Java-based Twitter app offers a simple CLI tool to interact with the Twitter API. It allows posting a tweet with geolocation, reading a tweet's JSON object, and deleting one or many tweets. The app uses OAuth to authorize Twitter interactions, is architectured as a Spring app with components for future extensibility, and comes with an extensive suite of tests based on JUnit, Mockito, and AssertJ. The Twitter CLI is packaged in a Docker container and uses Maven as a project management and comprehension tool.
  - JDBC App: This app allows accessing the RDBMS in a programmatic way instead of SQL. This makes the data from the database accessible to end users who are not comfortable with SQL, helps isolate the database from the end users for security purpose, and create the building blocks for future APIs and possibly a different front-end interface instead of a text/CLI one only.
  - Grep App: This app aims to implement a simple grep-like app in Java. The Java artifact is packaged in a Docker container for ease of deployment and makes use of Java regex utilities. It also uses streams and lambdas for a cleaner code, among other benefits. It can be run from the command line with as close of an experience and results as the Linux's grep (our reference for this project is the GNU Grep.


## Highlighted Projects
**Build a geolocalized aid platform for your neighborhood: Backend in Ruby on Rails API mode, running on Azure VM with nginx and HTTPS/TLS; Frontend in React/Javascript/leafletjs** [[GitHub](https://github.com/RtillaWork/P_8_BE)]: For the Bakdend and API, I designed, developed tested, and cloud-hosted an API that looks for nearby volunteer services or offers of help and serves that data to an authenticated frontend using HTTPS. As for the frontend (https://github.com/RtillaWork/P_8_FE), it was built in React and LeafletJs, as a map, that communicates with the API to link users' needing help with volunteers in the vicinity.

**Build a web scraper and downloader of online library catalogs and open public library resources** [[GitHub](https://github.com/RtillaWork/gogetitarchy)]: Built a web scraper of public library resources, particularly ArchiveGrid and OCLC with Go and Gocolly to facilitate exploratory research, downloading references, and eventually as a simpler command line search engine. Created a C++ utility to clean and extract preliminary data
