# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: I am a Junior Software Developer, with experience in Java, React, Golang, and Ruby on Rails. I graduated from OpenClassrooms with a E.U bachelor's equivalent. I am passionate about software quality and well-engineered solutions that take into account green or efficient tech, and social responsibility. I was, previously, a member of the Tier 3 Network Assurance and Provisioning Team at Telus, as a Telecom Network Technician. Besides that, I hold a diploma as a Telecom/electronics Technologist and a Bachelor in Business Administration with a Marketing major. I believe that lean, secure, and Open Source software can bring a unique added value to all the stakeholders, and clearer communication and can enable optimized and agile solutions to market needs. My other interests are Information Security and science education.

    description: "This app, which consists of a server and local agents, assists cluster admin teams to survey, collect, store and monitor cluster nodes. It uses standard Linux commands and "/sys" filesystem to collect a node's configuration and real-time information. The server collects and stores that data in a PostgreSQL database for documentation and querying. The app is deployed through a lightweight Docker container and uses bash shell's scripting language."

    git_url: "https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_NissaElchhab/tree/main/core_java"
    description:
      - "Twitter App: This Java-based Twitter app offers a simple CLI tool to interact with the Twitter API. It allows posting a tweet with geolocation, reading a tweet's JSON object, a deleting one or many tweets. The app uses OAuth to authorize Twitter interactions, is architectured around a 3-tiered model for ease of extensibility, and comes with an extensive suite of tests based on JUnit, Mockito, and AssertJ. The Twitter CLI is packaged in a Docker container as a Spring application"
      - "JDBC App: This app allows accessing the RDBMS in a programmatic way instead of SQL. This makes the data from the database accessible to end users who are not comfortable with SQL, helps isolate the database from the end users for security purpose, and create the building blocks for future APIs and possibly a different front-end interface instead of a text/CLI one only."
      - "Grep App: This app aims to implement a simple grep-like app in Java. The Java artifact is packaged in a Docker container for ease of deployment and makes use of Java regex utilities. It also uses streams and lambdas for a cleaner code, among other benefits. It can be run from the command line with as close of an experience and results as the Linux's grep (our reference for this project is the GNU Grep."
