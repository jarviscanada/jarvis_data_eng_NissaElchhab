# Introduce yourself, your academic and professional background.
# What excites you about the software industry and your passion. At least 80 words
summary: Software developer, Java, React, Golang, Rails (jr.), OpenClassrooms' graduate (EU bachelor equivalent as a software developer) and passionate about software quality and well-engineered solutions that take into account green, efficient tech, and social responsibility. I was, previously, a member of the Tier 3 Network Assurance and Provisioning Team at Telus, as a Telecom Network Technician. Besides that, I hold a diploma as a Telecom/electronics Technologist and a Bachelor in Business Administration with a Marketing major. I believe that lean, secure, and Open Source software can bring a unique added value to all the stakeholders, and clearer communication and can enable optimized and agile solutions to market needs. My other interests are Information Security and Infosec education.
